# Finding encryption key

This is part of Information Security course. The project task aims to find the the encryption key used to encrypt a plaintext. <br>
The known information is:<br>

- Plaintext: "This is a top secret.".<br>
- Ciphertext (in hex format): "764aa26b55a4da654df6b19e4bce00f4ed05e09346fb0e762583cb7da2ac93a2".<br>
- And the initial variable (IV in hex format): "aabbccddeeff00998877665544332211".<br>

I used the Crypto library in order to solve this task, more details of how the code works is in the enc.py file.
